### Contents

This here repository contains the code for a web application, design to host for now a full-fledged blog
software.

The bulk of the task is performed with the aid of Python's Django framework.
In addition to other technologies, and frameworks had been utilised, for more about that do check the wiki
of the project.

### Usage

Firstly, it is recommended that you utilise the provided virtual environment. 

This step is useful for two particular reasons:

<ol>
    <li>
    The virtual environment provided with the application is constantly updated, so that the Python image
    alongside with the libraries are always up-to-date, even if they might not be so on your machine.
    </li>
    <li>
    Utilising the virtual environment ensures that you do not have to worry about installing dependencies 
    or worrying about altering anything on your own machine.
    </li>
</ol>

To start the virtual environment simply tap within a shell/terminal session the following command:

``` shell
    source venv/Python/bin/activate
```
